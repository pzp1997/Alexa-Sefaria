# Sefaria for Alexa
### The (unofficial) Amazon Alexa skill for [Sefaria](http://www.sefaria.org/?home).

With the Sefaria skill, you now have access to an entire library of Jewish texts just by using your voice. You can ask Alexa for any verse in the Tanakh (Old Testament) and it will recite it for you.

As of now, Sefaria for Alexa only understands the Anglicized titles of books (e.g. Exodus, Deuteronomy). Additionally, only the default English version of the text is available. (This is mostly due to limitations in Alexa's capabilities at processing foreign languages, but I will look for potential workarounds.)
