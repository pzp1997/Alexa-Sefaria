# Tanakh (Powered by Sefaria)
### The unofficial Amazon Alexa skill for [Sefaria](http://www.sefaria.org/?home).

With the Sefaria skill, you now have access to an entire library of Jewish texts just by using your voice. You can ask Alexa for any verse (or range of verses) in the Tanakh (Old Testament) and it will recite it for you. You can also ask for commentaries on those verses.

As of now, Sefaria for Alexa only understands the Anglicized titles of books (e.g. Exodus, Deuteronomy). Additionally, only the default English version of the text is available.
